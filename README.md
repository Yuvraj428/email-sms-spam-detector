# email-sms-spam-detector
A machine learning–based email and SMS spam detection system using NLP techniques such as text preprocessing and TF-IDF vectorization to classify messages as spam or ham.

##  Overview
Spam messages are a common problem in digital communication.  
This project analyzes message content and applies text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning models to automatically detect spam messages.

##  Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Text preprocessing:
  - Lowercasing
  - Tokenization
  - Stopword removal
  - Stemming
- Feature extraction using **Bag of Words** and **TF-IDF**
- Training and evaluation of machine learning models
- Prediction of spam or ham messages

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLTK  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

## Dataset

The dataset contains labeled email and SMS messages:
- **Spam** – unwanted or promotional messages  
- **Ham** – legitimate messages
